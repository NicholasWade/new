Hot cross buns,
Hot cross buns,
One a penny,
Two a penny,
Hot cross buns.
If you have no daughters,
If you have no sons,
One a penny,
Two a penny,
Hot cross buns.
If your sons don't like them,
They're the only ones,
One a penny,
Two a penny,
Hot cross buns.
I don't tell jokes
and I don't tell puns,
One a penny,
Two a penny,
Hot cross buns.
Get them while they're hot
and eat them by the ton,
One a penny,
Two a penny,
Hot cross buns.
